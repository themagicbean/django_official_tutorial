<!--
Now we might be able to get away with putting our templates 
directly in polls/templates (rather than creating 
another polls subdirectory), but it would actually 
be a bad idea. Django will choose the first template 
it finds whose name matches, and if you had a template 
with the same name in a different application, Django 
would be unable to distinguish between them. We need to be 
able to point Django at the right one, and the easiest way 
to ensure this is by namespacing them. That is, by putting 
those templates inside another directory named for the 
application itself.
